# Portfolio
This is my portfolio which introduces some basic information about me. 

## Homepage
For me, everyone is a kind of class, with different functions. 
I have two static function to share with you, aboutMe() and findMe(), just click function to check its return value.

## About me
I list all my univerisies, and you can click them to get to their official website. 
//rather than "universities", "academic background" would better fits this page

You can send me a message through these social media.
